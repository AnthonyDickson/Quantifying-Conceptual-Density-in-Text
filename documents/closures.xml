            A set is closed under an operation if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces
            a member of that set. For example, the positive integers are closed under addition, but not under
            subtraction: is not a positive integer even though both 1 and 2 are positive integers. Another example is
            the set containing only zero, which is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication (because , ,
            and ). Similarly, a set is said to be closed under a collection of operations if it is closed under each of
            the operations individually.

        <title>Basic properties</title>
        <text>
            A set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a closure property.
            Often a closure property is introduced as an axiom, which is then usually called the axiom of closure.
            Modern set-theoretic definitions usually define operations as maps between sets, so adding closure to a
            structure as an axiom is superfluous; however in practice operations are often defined initially on a
            superset of the set in question and a closure proof is required to establish that the operation applied to
            pairs from that set only produces members of that set. For example, the set of even integers is closed under
            addition, but the set of odd integers is not. When a set S is not closed under some operations, one can
            usually find the smallest set containing S that is closed. This smallest closed set is called the closure of
            S (with respect to these operations). For example, the closure under subtraction of the set of natural
            numbers, viewed as a subset of the real numbers, is the set of integers. An important example is that of
            topological closure. The notion of closure is generalized by Galois connection, and further by monads.
            The set S must be a subset of a closed set in order for the closure operator to be defined. In the preceding
            example, it is important that the reals are closed under subtraction; in the domain of the natural numbers
            subtraction is not always defined. The two uses of the word "closure" should not be confused. The former
            usage refers to the property of being closed, and the latter refers to the smallest closed set containing
            one that may not be closed. In short, the closure of a set satisfies a closure property.

        <title>Closed sets</title>
        <text>
            A set is closed under an operation if the operation returns a member of the set when evaluated on members of
            the set. Sometimes the requirement that the operation be valued in a set is explicitly stated, in which case
            it is known as the axiom of closure. For example, one may define a group as a set with a binary product
            operator obeying several axioms, including an axiom that the product of any two elements of the group is
            again an element. However the modern definition of an operation makes this axiom superfluous; an n-ary
            operation on S is just a subset of S n+1. By its very definition, an operator on a set cannot have values
            outside the set. Nevertheless, the closure property of an operator on a set still has some utility. Closure
            on a set does not necessarily imply closure on all subsets. Thus a subgroup of a group is a subset on which
            the binary product and the unary operation of inversion satisfy the closure axiom. An operation of a
            different sort is that of finding the limit points of a subset of a topological space. A set that is closed
            under this operation is usually referred to as a closed set in the context of topology. Without any further
            qualification, the phrase usually means closed in this sense. Closed intervals like [1,2] = {x : 1 ≤ x ≤ 2}
            are closed in this sense. A subset of a partially ordered set is a downward closed set (also called a lower
            set) if for every element of the subset, all smaller elements are also in the subset. This applies for
            example to the real intervals (−∞, p) and (−∞, p], and for an ordinal number p represented as interval [0,
            p). Every downward closed set of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal number. Upward closed sets (also
            called upper sets) are defined similarly.

            In topology and related branches, the relevant operation is taking limits. The topological closure of a set
            is the corresponding closure operator. The Kuratowski closure axioms characterize this operator.
            In linear algebra, the linear span of a set X of vectors is the closure of that set; it is the smallest
            subset of the vector space that includes X and is closed under the operation of linear combination. This
            subset is a subspace.
            In matroid theory, the closure of X is the largest superset of X that has the same rank as X.
            In set theory, the transitive closure of a set.
            In set theory, the transitive closure of a binary relation.
            In algebra, the algebraic closure of a field.
            In commutative algebra, closure operations for ideals, as integral closure and tight closure.
            In geometry, the convex hull of a set S of points is the smallest convex set of which S is a subset.
            In formal languages, the Kleene closure of a language can be described as the set of strings that can be
            made by concatenating zero or more strings from that language.
            In group theory, the conjugate closure or normal closure of a set of group elements is the smallest normal
            subgroup containing the set.
            In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, the closure of a collection of subsets of X under
            countably many set operations is called the σ-algebra generated by the collection.

        <title>Closure operator</title>
        <text>
            Given an operation on a set X, one can define the closure C(S) of a subset S of X to be the smallest subset
            closed under that operation that contains S as a subset, if any such subsets exist. Consequently, C(S) is
            the intersection of all closed sets containing S. For example, the closure of a subset of a group is the
            subgroup generated by that set. The closure of sets with respect to some operation defines a closure
            operator on the subsets of X. The closed sets can be determined from the closure operator; a set is closed
            if it is equal to its own closure. Typical structural properties of all closure operations are:
            The closure is increasing or extensive: the closure of an object contains the object.
            The closure is idempotent: the closure of the closure equals the closure.
            The closure is monotone, that is, if X is contained in Y, then also C(X) is contained in C(Y).

            An object that is its own closure is called closed. By idempotency, an object is closed if and only if it is
            the closure of some object. These three properties define an abstract closure operator. Typically, an
            abstract closure acts on the class of all subsets of a set. If X is contained in a set closed under the
            operation then every subset of X has a closure.

            Consider first homogeneous relations R ⊆ A × A. If a relation S satisfies aSb ⇒ bSa, then it is a symmetric
            relation. An arbitrary homogeneous relation R may not be symmetric but it is always contained in some
            symmetric relation: R ⊆ S. The operation of finding the smallest such S corresponds to a closure operator
            called symmetric closure. A transitive relation T satisfies aTb ∧ bTc ⇒ aTc. An arbitrary homogeneous
            relation R may not be transitive but it is always contained in some transitive relation: R ⊆ T. The
            operation of finding the smallest such T corresponds to a closure operator called transitive closure.
            Among heterogeneous relations there are properties of difunctionality and contact which lead to difunctional
            closure and contact closure. The presence of these closure operators in binary relations leads to
            topology since open-set axioms may be replaced by Kuratowski closure axioms. Thus each property P, symmetry,
            transitivity, difunctionality, or contact corresponds to a relational topology.
            In the theory of rewriting systems, one often uses more wordy notions such as the reflexive transitive
            closure R *— the smallest preorder containing R, or the reflexive transitive symmetric closure R
            ≡—the smallest equivalence relation containing R, and therefore also known as the equivalence closure. When
            considering a particular term algebra, an equivalence relation that is compatible with all operations of the
            algebra is called a congruence relation. The congruence closure of R is defined as the smallest congruence
            relation containing R. For arbitrary P and R, the P closure of R need not exist. In the above examples,
            these exist because reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry are closed under arbitrary intersections. In such
            cases, the P closure can be directly defined as the intersection of all sets with property P containing R.
            Some important particular closures can be constructively obtained as follows: clref (R) = R ∪ { ⟨x,x⟩ : x ∈
            S } is the reflexive closure of R, clsym(R) = R ∪ { ⟨y,x⟩ : ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ R } is its symmetric closure, cl trn (R)
            = R ∪ { ⟨x1 ,xn ⟩ : n >1 ∧ ⟨x1 ,x2 ⟩, ..., ⟨xn-1 ,xn ⟩ ∈ R } is its transitive closure, clemb,Σ(R) = R ∪ {
            ⟨f(x1 ,…,xi-1 ,xi ,xi+1 ,…,xn ), f(x1 ,…,xi-1 ,y,xi+1 ,…,xn )⟩ : ⟨xi ,y⟩ ∈ R ∧ f ∈ Σ n-ary ∧ 1 ≤ i ≤ n ∧ x1
            ,...,xn ∈ S } is its embedding closure with respect to a given set Σ of operations on S, each with a fixed
            arity. The relation R is said to have closure under some clxxx , if R = clxxx (R); for example R is called
            symmetric if R = clsym(R). Any of these four closures preserves symmetry, i.e., if R is symmetric, so is any
            clxxx (R). Similarly, all four preserve reflexivity. Moreover, cl trn preserves closure under clemb,Σ for
            arbitrary Σ. As a consequence, the equivalence closure of an arbitrary binary relation R can be obtained as
            cl trn(clsym(clref(R))), and the congruence closure with respect to some Σ can be obtained as cl
            trn(clemb,Σ(clsym(clref(R)))). In the latter case, the nesting order does matter; e.g. if S is the set of
            terms over Σ = { a, b, c, f } and R = { ⟨a,b⟩, ⟨f(b),c⟩ }, then the pair ⟨f(a),c⟩ is contained in the
            congruence closure cl trn(clemb,Σ(clsym(clref(R)))) of R, but not in the relation clemb,Σ(cl
            trn(clsym(clref(R)))).
