        <title>It is a Feature</title>
        <text>
            It is not a bug, it is a feature! My code does exactly
            what I intended it to do! This motto will keep you motivated and encouraged
            to keep on being that programming rock star that everyone aspires to become.

            We all know that it is common knowledge that fixing one bug will introduce
            many more bugs. So why fix bugs if they are just going to introduce more?
            So let's just comment out the code that causes the bug (This may or may
            not have a cascading effect).
