        We all know that it is common knowledge that fixing one <entity>bug</entity> will introduce
        many more bugs. So why fix bugs if they are just going to introduce more?
        So let's just <entity>comment</entity> out the code that causes the bug (This may or may
        not have a cascading effect).
