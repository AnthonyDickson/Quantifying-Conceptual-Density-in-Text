Some things are more difficult than others to learn or understand.
It is theorised that a component of this difficulty is intrinsic to the material itself.
The core of this theory is that the number of concepts present in the material and the degree to which these concepts interact and are interdependent plays a large role in ones ability to understand the material.
We propose conceptual density to capture this effect. We establish a definition of conceptual density and a method of quantifying it in the context of text documents through natural language processing techniques.
